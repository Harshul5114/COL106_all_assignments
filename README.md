# COL106 - Data Structures and Algorithms (IIT Delhi)

This repository contains all assignments completed as part of the COL106 course (Data Structures and Algorithms) at IIT Delhi. Each assignment focuses on a different core data structure or algorithm and includes a set of interrelated classes, all implemented from scratch — without using any built-in containers like `dict`, `set`, or external libraries.

## 📁 Repository Structure

Each assignment is contained in its own folder:

```
Assignment 1/
Assignment 2/
Assignment 3/
...
```

Each folder includes:

* `main.py` – Entry point to test or demo the assignment.
* Python modules implementing data structures and logic.
* Supporting classes and exception handlers (if applicable).

## 🚀 How to Run

To run a specific assignment, navigate to its directory and execute `main.py`:

```bash
cd "Assignment 1"
python3 main.py
```

Replace `1` with the assignment number you want to run.

## Topics Covered

* Stack-based maze navigation
* AVL Trees for cargo allocation
* Custom Heaps for scheduling
* Graph traversal and routing algorithms
* Priority-based simulation systems
* Modular system design with exception handling

## Note

* All data structures and algorithms have been implemented manually as part of course constraints.
* No external Python libraries (like NumPy, pandas, etc.) were used unless explicitly allowed.
