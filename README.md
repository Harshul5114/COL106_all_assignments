# COL106 - Data Structures and Algorithms (IIT Delhi)

This repository contains all assignments completed as part of the COL106 course (Data Structures and Algorithms) at IIT Delhi. Each assignment focuses on a different core data structure or algorithm and includes a set of interrelated classes, all implemented from scratch — without using any built-in containers like `dict`, `set`, or external libraries.

## 📁 Repository Structure

Each assignment consists of multiple Python files, organized per module/class. Key files typically include:

- `main.py` – Entry point to run test cases or demo the assignment.
- Core logic modules like `stack.py`, `heap.py`, `avl.py`, `planner.py`, etc.
- Support classes such as `bin.py`, `object.py`, `flight.py`, etc.
- Exception classes (when required).

## 🚀 How to Run

For most assignments:

```bash
python3 main.py
